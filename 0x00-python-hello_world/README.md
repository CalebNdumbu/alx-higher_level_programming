## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to various Python programming tasks. Each task is located in a separate directory, named according to its task number. Inside each directory, you'll find a Python script or C code file that implements the solution to the respective task. Additionally, there are instructions provided within each task's description for running or compiling the code.

## Setup

To run or compile the code in this repository, you'll need:

- Python 3.x (for Python tasks)
- GCC (for C tasks)

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alx-higher_level_programming
```

Navigate to the respective task directory to find the specific files.
