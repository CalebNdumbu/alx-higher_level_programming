# Readme File for Python Projects

This repository contains solutions to various Python programming tasks. Each task is categorized based on its level of difficulty and requirements. Below is a brief overview of each task along with its description and usage instructions.

## Task Descriptions

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
This program assigns a random signed number to a variable `number` each time it is executed. The program prints whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive, negative, or zero.

### 1. The last digit
Similar to Task 0, this program assigns a random signed number to a variable `number` each time it is executed. It prints the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
Similar to Task 2, this program prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', not followed by a new line.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing
This program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats.

### 5. 00...99
This program prints numbers from 0 to 99 in ascending order, with two digits separated by a comma and space.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order, separated by a comma and space.

### 7. islower
This program defines a function `islower(c)` that checks if a character is lowercase.

### 8. To uppercase
This program defines a function `uppercase(str)` that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
This program defines a function `print_last_digit(number)` that prints the last digit of a number.

### 10. a + b
This program defines a function `add(a, b)` that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. a ^ b
This program defines a function `pow(a, b)` that computes a to the power of b and returns the value.

### 12. Fizz Buzz
This program prints numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz", for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz", and for multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".

### 13. Insert in sorted linked list
This program defines a function `insert_node(head, number)` in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### 14. Smile in the mirror
This program prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.

### 15. Remove at position
This program defines a function `remove_char_at(str, n)` that creates a copy of a string, removing the character at the position n.

### 16. ByteCode -> Python #2
This program defines a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b, c)` that performs the same operations as a given Python bytecode.

## Usage
Each task is accompanied by example usage instructions or test cases to demonstrate the expected output. You can run the provided scripts or functions in your Python environment to verify their functionality.
