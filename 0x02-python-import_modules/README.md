This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to importing modules in Python.

## Tasks

1. **Import a simple function from a simple file**
   - Filename: `0-add.py`
   - Description: Imports the function `add(a, b)` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.

2. **My first toolbox!**
   - Filename: `1-calculation.py`
   - Description: Imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py`, performs mathematical operations, and prints the results.

3. **How to make a script dynamic!**
   - Filename: `2-args.py`
   - Description: Prints the number of and the list of arguments passed to the script.

4. **Infinite addition**
   - Filename: `3-infinite_add.py`
   - Description: Prints the result of the addition of all arguments passed to the script.

5. **Who are you?**
   - Filename: `4-hidden_discovery.py`
   - Description: Prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.

6. **Everything can be imported**
   - Filename: `5-variable_load.py`
   - Description: Imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.

7. **Build my own calculator! (Advanced)**
   - Filename: `100-my_calculator.py`
   - Description: Imports all functions from `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations.

8. **Easy print (Advanced)**
   - Filename: `101-easy_print.py`
   - Description: Prints `#pythoniscool` in the standard output.

9. **ByteCode -> Python #3 (Advanced)**
   - Filename: `102-magic_calculation.py`
   - Description: Defines a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that performs certain operations similar to a given Python bytecode.

10. **Fast alphabet (Advanced)**
    - Filename: `103-fast_alphabet.py`
    - Description: Prints the alphabet in uppercase without using loops, conditional statements, or system calls.

Each script is accompanied by a brief description of its functionality and usage.
